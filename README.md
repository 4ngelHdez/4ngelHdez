### What about me???

I began my career with a degree in Business Administration, gaining solid experience in cost analysis and budget control. Today, Iâ€™m changing my career path into the exciting world of Data Analytics.<br>

Throughout my career, I have worked with financial information, creating reports and analyses that supported strategic decision-making. This experience sparked my passion for technology and the power of data analysis to transform businesses.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in Python, SQL, and ETL using tools such as Visual Studio Code, Azure Data Studio, Microsoft SQL Server, Power BI, Tableau, and Google BigQuery. My training is hands-on, with a strong focus on solving real-world problems.<br>
